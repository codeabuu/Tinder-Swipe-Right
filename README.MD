## App Design & Main Features

- Once you create an account, you will start seeing profiles of different users based on your preferences.
- For every user of the app, Tinder shows these information details: current age, mutual friends (via matching preferences), mutual interests between the users, and target description. The process of matching starts here when you can do the following:

* Swipe-Right/Tick: If you like a profile, you will swipe right.
* Swipe-Left: If you don’t like a profile, you will swipe left.
* Match: If both the profiles swipe right, it’s a match.
